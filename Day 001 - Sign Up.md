# Day 001: Sign Up Form for Nook
For Day 1 of the Daily UI challenge, I created a sign up form for **Nook**, a book club application for reading enthusiasts.

## Design System
### Palette
Our carefully selected palette combines soothing tones inspired by nature. Imagine the calming hues of soft greens and warm neutrals. This palette is easy on the eyes, creating an inviting space for exploration and discussion.
### Logo
Our logo is more than just a symbol; it's a visual story of community and connection. The intertwined "O"s not only resemble the comfort of a cozy nook but also encircle a book at the bottom, signifying the shared love for literature within our community. It's a subtle nod to the idea that stories weave us together.
