# UI-Challenges
## Introduction
Hey there! I'm Jalex, a passionate designer and aspiring web developer. This repository is my creative playground where I embark on a daily journey to enhance my design skills through the Daily UI Challenge.
## What is the Daily UI Challenge?
The Daily UI Challenge is a fantastic initiative that provides a daily dose of design prompts to inspire creativity and improve design proficiency. Each day presents a new challenge, ranging from simple elements to complex interfaces, encouraging designers to explore various aspects of user interface design.
## Repository Structure
In this repository, you'll find a structured organization of my Daily UI Challenge creations. Each challenge is neatly categorized, making it easy for you to explore my design evolution over time. Feel free to dive into specific days or witness the overall progression of my skills.
### How to Navigate
1. **Browse by day**: Explore each day's challenge individually to witness my unique approach to different design prompts.
2. **Explore Categories**: Navigate through specific categories such as buttons, forms, landing pages, and more to see how I tackle diverse design elements.
3. **Follow My Journey***: Check the README file within each challenge folder for insights, thoughts, and the design process behind that particular day's creation.
